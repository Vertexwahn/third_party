# Announcing C-Blosc2 2.12.0
A fast, compressed and persistent binary data store library for C.

## What is new?

Now the `grok` codec is available globally and will be loaded dynamically. See more
info about the codec in our blog post: https://www.blosc.org/posts/blosc2-grok-release/
Furthermore, a new function has been added to get the unidimensional chunk indexes
needed to get the slice of a Blosc2 container.

For more info, please see the release notes in:

## What is it?

Blosc2 is a high performance data container optimized for binary data.
It builds on the shoulders of Blosc, the high performance meta-compressor
(https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc).

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever
container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the super-block name).
It supports storing data on both memory and disk using the same API.
Also, it adds more compressors and filters.
